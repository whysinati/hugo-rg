My book project, Buckskin to Gore-Tex: The Outdoor Industry in American History, explores the cultural, intellectual, and environmental history of the outdoor gear industry.

From Stetson hats and buckskin suits to army surplus tents and Gore-Tex rain jackets, outdoor gear and its marketing in catalogs, stores, and guidebooks are a means to understanding how Americans strove for an authentic mastery of the outdoors. I argue that consuming became central to Americans’ goal of mastering the outdoors.

Fellowships from the [Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu/), the [Lemelson Center](http://invention.si.edu/), and the [Hagley Center for the History of Business, Technology, and Society](http://www.hagley.org/research/programs) helped support this research, as have the many grants and awards listed here. I’ve presented material at the annual conferences of the [American Society for Environmental History](http://aseh.org/), the [Organization of American Historians](http://www.oah.org/), and the [American Historical Association](https://www.historians.org/).
